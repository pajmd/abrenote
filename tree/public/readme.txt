The UI will have 3 panes
one for all de folders (node), one for the content of a folder, i.e. 
the note titles, 
one for the content of a note, i.e. the text.

selecting a folder will display all the note titles
selecting a note titles will display the text of the note.

See 
http://jsfiddle.net/brendanowen/uXbn6/8/ for a simple tree structure.

I want to add buttons on the top to:
- create a new folder based an already select folder
- create a new note based on the folder selected (maybe this button should be on the top on the 
note titles pane)
